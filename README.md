# Snek!

> Theme: Vintage

## What is this?

It's a modification of the original snake game. Notably:
*  You can wrap around the edges (instead of game over)
*  The game may hang once the snake is long enough :trollface:

## How to start?

*  Hit one of the arrow keys to start
*  Hit enter at any point to restart the game
